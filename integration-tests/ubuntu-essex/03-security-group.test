Feature: Test security groups
    In order to smoke test security group functionality
    As tester
    I want to start 3 instances in different security groups. Then allow traffic between 2 of them and check that allowed and disallowed traffic works as it should.

    Scenario: Setup prerequisites
        Require setup "keystone-init ! vm-image ! novaclient-keys"


    Scenario: Add 3 security groups, check them added.
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And I see security group "{{security_group.name}}-1" does not exist
        And I see security group "{{security_group.name}}-2" does not exist
        And I see security group "{{security_group.name}}-3" does not exist
        When I add security group "{{security_group.name}}-1"
        And I add security group "{{security_group.name}}-2"
        And I add security group "{{security_group.name}}-3"
        Then I see security group "{{security_group.name}}-1" exist
        And I see security group "{{security_group.name}}-2" exist
        And I see security group "{{security_group.name}}-3" exist


    Scenario: Add rules for me to access instances
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And I see security group "{{security_group.name}}-1" exist
        And I see security group "{{security_group.name}}-2" exist
        And I see security group "{{security_group.name}}-3" exist

        When I add rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{net.cloud.cc}}" to access port "22" in group ""
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{net.cloud.cc}}" to access port "22" in group "{{security_group.name}}-1"
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{net.cloud.cc}}" to access port "22" in group "{{security_group.name}}-2"
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{net.cloud.cc}}" to access port "22" in group "{{security_group.name}}-3"

        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{net.cloud.cc}}" to access port "" in group ""
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{net.cloud.cc}}" to access port "" in group "{{security_group.name}}-1"
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{net.cloud.cc}}" to access port "" in group "{{security_group.name}}-2"
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{net.cloud.cc}}" to access port "" in group "{{security_group.name}}-3"

        Then I see rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{net.cloud.cc}}" to access port "22" in group "" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{net.cloud.cc}}" to access port "22" in group "{{security_group.name}}-1" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{net.cloud.cc}}" to access port "22" in group "{{security_group.name}}-2" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{net.cloud.cc}}" to access port "22" in group "{{security_group.name}}-3" exist

        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{net.cloud.cc}}" to access port "" in group "" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{net.cloud.cc}}" to access port "" in group "{{security_group.name}}-1" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{net.cloud.cc}}" to access port "" in group "{{security_group.name}}-2" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{net.cloud.cc}}" to access port "" in group "{{security_group.name}}-3" exist

    Scenario: Workaround for dnsmasq hang up
        I run commands:
        |  Command                            | Expected |
        |  sudo killall dnsmasq \|\| echo     |  noFail  |
        |  sudo service nova-network restart  |  noFail  |

    Scenario: Start instance
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And VM image "{{image.name}}" is registered
        And keypair with name "{{vm.keypair.name}}" exists
        When I spawn VM instance "{{vm.name}}" using image named "{{image.name}}", flavor named "{{vm.flavor}}" and keypair named "{{vm.keypair.name}}" in security group "{{security_group.name}}-1"
        Then VM instance "{{vm.name}}" comes up within "{{vm.boot_timeout}}" seconds
        And VM instance "{{vm.name}}" is pingable within "{{vm.ping_deadline}}" seconds
        And I see that "ssh" port of VM instance "{{vm.name}}" is open and serves "ssh" protocol within "{{vm.ping_deadline}}" seconds
        And I can log into VM "{{vm.name}}" via SSH as "{{vm.user}}" with key "{{vm.keypair.private}}"
        And I login to VM "{{vm.name}}" via SSH as "{{vm.user}}" with key "{{vm.keypair.private}}" and run commands:
            |  Command  |   Expected  |
            |   whoami  |   root      |


    Scenario: Start 2nd instance
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And VM image "{{image.name}}" is registered
        And keypair with name "{{vm.keypair.name}}" exists
        When I spawn VM instance "{{vm2.name}}" using image named "{{image.name}}", flavor named "{{vm.flavor}}" and keypair named "{{vm.keypair.name}}" in security group "{{security_group.name}}-2"
        Then VM instance "{{vm2.name}}" comes up within "{{vm2.boot_timeout}}" seconds
        And VM instance "{{vm2.name}}" is pingable within "{{vm2.ping_deadline}}" seconds
        And I see that "ssh" port of VM instance "{{vm2.name}}" is open and serves "ssh" protocol within "{{vm2.ping_deadline}}" seconds
        And I can log into VM "{{vm2.name}}" via SSH as "{{vm2.user}}" with key "{{vm.keypair.private}}"
        And I login to VM "{{vm2.name}}" via SSH as "{{vm2.user}}" with key "{{vm.keypair.private}}" and run commands:
            |  Command  |   Expected  |
            |   whoami  |   root      |


    Scenario: Start 3rd instance
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And VM image "{{image.name}}" is registered
        And keypair with name "{{vm.keypair.name}}" exists
        When I spawn VM instance "{{vm3.name}}" using image named "{{image.name}}", flavor named "{{vm.flavor}}" and keypair named "{{vm.keypair.name}}" in security group "{{security_group.name}}-3"
        Then VM instance "{{vm3.name}}" comes up within "{{vm3.boot_timeout}}" seconds
        And VM instance "{{vm3.name}}" is pingable within "{{vm3.ping_deadline}}" seconds
        And I see that "ssh" port of VM instance "{{vm3.name}}" is open and serves "ssh" protocol within "{{vm3.ping_deadline}}" seconds

# Creating rules and checking traffic  ---------------


    Scenario: Add rule to allow all traffic from SG2 pass to SG3
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available

        And I add rule allow from group "{{security_group.name}}-3", protocol "", host "" to access port "" in group "{{security_group.name}}-2"

# BUG HERE,adding from group to group permission adds 3 lines: TCP, UDP and ICMP to allow. Now UDP and ICMP is missing

    Scenario: Login to 2nd instance and check traffic can pass to 3rd instance and cannot pass to 1st
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And I can log into VM "{{vm2.name}}" via SSH as "{{vm2.user}}" with key "{{vm.keypair.private}}"
