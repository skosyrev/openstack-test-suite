Feature: Create user and project using python-novaclient CLI
    In order to prepare environment for smoke test
    As cloud admin
    I want to perform network setup

    Scenario: Create network
#        Given nova project "{{project.name}}" exists
        When I create nova network "{{net.cloud.cidr}}" labeled "integration_tests_net", bridge_interface "{{net.external_interface}}", vlan id "100"
        Then nova network "{{net.cloud.cidr}}" exists
